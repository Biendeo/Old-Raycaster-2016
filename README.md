# Raycast Test

I'm testing how to do raycasting in SDL2 using C++. Help me along if you want.

## Setup
If you're using Visual Studio 2015, then the solution should set up everything automatically. It comes with the correct version of SDL, and the build properties are set up so you can build right away. For other platforms and compilers, the code should be easy to set up, but you'll need to get the SDL libraries from somewhere for that.
